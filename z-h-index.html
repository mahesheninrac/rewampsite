            <strong> Hydrogen production costs </strong> and efficiencies vary
            widely by method and geography. In India, reliance on imported
            natural gas raises the cost of grey and blue hydrogen compared to
            global averages. While green hydrogen remains costlier today,
            aggressive renewables expansion and policy support are
            <strong> expected to bring costs down to ~$2/kg by 2030.</strong>
            Biomass gasification, leveraging India’s agricultural residue,
            offers a promising decentralized route. This comparative analysis
            highlights how India’s hydrogen strategy must balance technology
            maturity,

            Further, aligning cost competitiveness with global benchmarks is
            essential for India to emerge as a key hydrogen exporter.
            Electrolyzer localization, viability gap funding, and scale-driven
            cost reductions will be crucial. Strategic production clusters near
            RE zones, ports, and industrial hubs can enhance economics. Policy
            clarity and cross-sectoral coordination will determine India’s pace
            in
            <strong>
              capturing its share of the $100B+ global green hydrogen trade
              opportunity.
            </strong>
            Moreover, regional production incentives,
            <strong>
              carbon pricing mechanisms, and renewable energy banking policies
              will shape investor confidence.</strong
            >
            India's ability to integrate hydrogen into refining, fertilizer,
            steel, and mobility sectors will directly influence demand scaling.
            The convergence of public-private capital, innovation ecosystems,
            and strategic international partnerships will define India’s
            leadership in the hydrogen economy.

            Hydrogen storage remains a critical enabler for realizing the
            hydrogen economy—impacting transport, distribution, and end-use
            efficiency. As per Eninrac’s market intelligence, the global
            hydrogen storage market is poised to cross
            <strong>
              $30 billion by 2030, with India contributing an estimated $2.4
              billion,
            </strong>
            led by compressed gas and emerging cryogenic solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compressed
            <strong>
              hydrogen gas storage (350–700 bar) continues to dominate early
              deployments, but its low energy density (1.2–1.5 kWh/kg)
            </strong>
            and energy-intensive compression present safety and cost trade-offs.
            India’s share in this segment is projected at $1.2 billion, driven
            by mobility and backup power applications. However, advanced Type IV
            tank materials and improved valve technologies remain critical to
            cost optimization. In parallel, liquid hydrogen (LH2) offers higher
            energy
            <strong>
              density (2.3–2.8 kWh/kg), yet faces challenges of ~1% daily
              boil-off losses,

            <strong> Team Eninrac’s assessment</strong> underscores that a
            <strong> diversified storage portfolio,</strong> tailored by
            application (stationary, mobility, maritime) and
            <strong> aligned with material science innovations,</strong> will be
            vital to India’s competitive positioning in the $200B+ global
            hydrogen value chain.

            How Does India’s Hydrogen Transportation Infrastructure Compare with
            Global Benchmarks?
          </h4>
          <p>
            India’s hydrogen transportation infrastructure is gradually aligning
            with global benchmarks.
            <strong>
              Eninrac’s market research reveals that while the EU and U.S. lead
              with 5,000+ km of dedicated hydrogen pipelines, India is targeting
              1,500 km by 2030 led by GAIL’s 1,200 km project.</strong
            >
            Blending hydrogen into natural gas grids is also gaining traction,
            with NTPC spearheading 5% pilot programs. On the cryogenic front,
            India plans 50+ liquid hydrogen tankers, compared to 500+ globally.
            Meanwhile, green ammonia is emerging as a viable export carrier,
            with terminals in Gujarat and Odisha planned by 2030. As India
            builds out this logistics backbone, infrastructure investments will
            be pivotal in unlocking cost-efficient hydrogen delivery.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>
              Eninrac analysts highlight that transport mode selection must
              balance cost, scalability, and technological maturity. </strong
            >While pipelines offer long-term economic advantages for bulk
            transport, blending remains a quick-start solution for early market
            activation. Cryogenic and ammonia-based routes will likely dominate
            export-oriented strategies, especially with Reliance, ACME, and
            Greenko actively pursuing partnerships. The development of
            standards, right-of-way frameworks, and carrier-specific safety
            protocols will be vital. <br /><br />
            India’s success in this space will hinge on synchronized action
            between public utilities, private developers, and regulatory bodies
            under the National Green Hydrogen Mission. Furthermore, leveraging
            India's existing gas infrastructure for low-blend hydrogen
            integration could reduce near-term CAPEX and fast-track regional
            hydrogen hubs. Eninrac analysts also emphasize the importance of
            indigenizing tanker manufacturing and developing specialized port
            infrastructure to handle ammonia and liquid hydrogen safely. As
            global hydrogen trade corridors evolve, India’s proactive alignment
            with international codes and certification standards will be crucial
            for market access and competitiveness.

          India, led by players like
          <strong>L&amp;T Energy Green Tech,</strong> is emerging as a
          competitive hub for green hydrogen production.
          <strong> With a price of $4.67/kg (₹397/kg),</strong> L&amp;T’s
          hydrogen offering is already aligned with global low-cost producers
          such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, whose prices range
          <strong>between $4.50–$6.00/kg.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          When factoring in <strong>logistics and import costs,</strong> Indian
          green hydrogen is
          <strong> cheaper than most EU-imported hydrogen,</strong> which lands
          at ₹500–600/kg. This cost advantage is further reinforced by
          <strong>India’s ultra-low solar tariffs (₹2.5–3/kWh),</strong> among
          the lowest globally, which significantly reduce the cost of
          electrolysis-based hydrogen production.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notably, L&amp;T's bid prices

            benefits,</strong
          >
          indicating room for even lower prices once policy support is fully
          leveraged. While global peers benefit from aggressive subsidies like
          the <strong> US IRA ($3/kg) and EU RFNBO subsidies,</strong> India's
          cost base is largely driven by
          <strong>natural competitiveness </strong> in renewable energy. This
          positions India and L&amp;T specifically

            Realistic Implications of India’s Green Hydrogen Push: A Phased
            Perspective
          </p>
          <p>
            India’s green hydrogen rollout is poised to deliver tangible impacts
            in both the short and long term. Between 2024 and 2027, early
            industrial adopters, particularly in refineries and fertilizer
            production will drive initial demand. This foundational uptake will
            be critical for de-risking investments,<strong>
              with $2–3 billion expected to flow into domestic electrolyzer
              manufacturing.</strong
            >
            By 2030, deeper decarbonization in hard-to-abate sectors like steel
            and transport will take shape, positioning
            <strong
              >India to capture 5–10% of the global electrolyzer market.</strong
            >
            On the socio-economic front, each 100,000 TPA project could generate
            around 5,000 jobs, providing a significant boost to engineering and
            O&amp;M sectors.
            <strong
              >Environmentally, a single project like Panipat could cut 1
              million tonnes of CO₂ annually.</strong
            >
            If India scales to 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030, it
            will make a substantial contribution toward meeting its NDC targets
            marking green hydrogen as both a climate and industrial
            transformation enabler.

              Low Price Discovery in India’s Green Hydrogen Market: Key
              Structural Challenges
            </p>
            <p>
              While India’s recent green hydrogen bids signal strong global
              competitiveness, the aggressive price
              <strong>discovery below $5/kg </strong> raises several structural
              challenges that could impact long-term market sustainability.
              These challenges are enlisted as below:
            </p>
            <div class="">
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Electrolyzer Viability</strong> remains a pressing
                    concern. With bid margins already tight, domestic
                    manufacturers may find it unviable to scale without
                    Production Linked Incentives (PLI). Compounding this is the
                    influx of ultra-low-cost Chinese electrolyzers priced at
                    ~$400/kW, which threaten to undercut Indian OEMs and stall
                    local capacity development.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong> Renewable Energy </strong>Integration poses
                    technical constraints. As green hydrogen production scales,
                    India's grid could face stability issues if renewable energy
                    penetration surpasses 40%, especially without adequate
                    storage and smart grid solutions. Meanwhile, competitors
                    like the Middle East benefit from near-continuous solar-wind
                    availability, reducing intermittency costs.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong> Subsidy Dependence</strong> is another area of
                    vulnerability. The viability of current low prices hinges
                    heavily on schemes like SIGHT. Should globally trade
                    policies like the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism
                    (CBAM)—scrutinize subsidy-backed exports, India may face
                    restricted market access or increased tariffs.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Technology Risk</strong> looms large. India's market
                    is still dominated by alkaline electrolyzers, while advanced
                    technologies like PEM and SOEC remain underdeveloped
                    domestically. As global players invest in next-gen,
                    high-efficiency systems, India risks falling behind unless
                    R&amp;D and commercialization efforts are rapidly
                    accelerated.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p class="text-primary">
                In sum, while India’s price competitiveness is commendable, a
                balanced strategy is essential, one that supports innovation,
                ensures fair margins, and fortifies grid and industrial
                readiness to deliver a resilient green hydrogen ecosystem.
